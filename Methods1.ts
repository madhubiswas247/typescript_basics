  /*
  A function property on a class is called a method. 
  Methods can use all the same type annotations as functions and constructors:
  Other than the standard type annotations, TypeScript 
  doesnâ€™t add anything else new to methods.

Note that inside a method body, it is still mandatory to 
access fields and other methods via this.
